A RoR app as a simple GUI wrapper for the Duck Encoder. 
Configure it to serve remotely and you have a way of encoding ducky scripts on a portable device with a browser and file system. 

Tested with DuckEncoder (this app) running on an OSX host, and accessing it from an Android client via web browser.
